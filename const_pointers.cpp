    //* A non-const pointer can be assigned another address to change what it is pointing at
    //* A const pointer always points to the same address, and this address can not be changed

    //* A pointer to a non-const value can change the value it is pointing to. These can not point to a const value
    //* A pointer to a const value treats the value as const when accessed through the pointer, and thus can not change the value it is pointing to. 
    // These can be pointed to const or non-const l-values //! but not r-values, which donâ€™t have an address
